Detailed information about this course

Description

The course will present the basic precepts and the principles underlying the primary methods of epidemiologic data analysis and statistical methods. The aim of the course is for the participant to arrive at a coherent conceptualization of the core principles of scientific thinking, epidemiologic data analysis with emphasis on interpretation of current scientific literature. This course is a general introduction to the basics of statistics used in biomedical and public health applications. 

We start with a general introduction to science understanding before any statistics highlighting the difference between description, explanation, and prediction. First, the concept of collecting data in health research as well as study designs, aims of the analysis and appropriate research questions (critical stage before anything). Then, we introduce some definitions of statistics, the notions of population, sample, variables (qualitative and quantitative) and data. Next, the course focusses on ways to describe data such as tables, graphs, distributions, and summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles) as reported in medical and health journals. The course will then turn on the relation between the population and the random sample and on how characteristics observed in the sample can be or cannot be generalized to the population. Finally, we will provide a general overview to the approach to data analysis of continuous, dichotomous, and time-to-event data. Relative risk, odds ratio and hazard ratio will also be discussed.

We shall briefly review some of the most frequently used statistical procedures with emphasis on their interpretation: correlation test, unpaired and paired t-tests for comparing two means values, analysis of variance for comparing several means, chi-squared test (Fisher exact test) for comparing two proportions and more generally for contingency tables, McNemar test for paired proportions. The basic principles underlying nonparametric tests will be outlined and some of the most used distribution-free tests presented (Wilcoxon signed rank test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test). We will provide a bunch of examples from the literature.

After covering the analysis of crude data, the focus shifts briefly to stratified analysis and multivariable models. The logistic model and Cox model will be briefly alluded to because of their importance in the medical literature.


Teaching Methods
The course consists of lectures, case studies involving reading and classroom discussion and assignments.

Objectives
1.	Students will receive a broad introduction from basic epidemiologic data to interpretation of common statistical analysis.
2.	Students will be able to explain and demonstrate the advantages of describing data appropriately as a first step of the scientific method. 
3.	Students will develop skills during data description, presentation, and summary.


Participant profile
Anyone with an interest in the principles of epidemiologic data analysis may apply. It is recommended that applicants have completed a basic course in epidemiologic study design.
